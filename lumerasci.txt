Lumera heaved a low sigh, frowning at the malfunctioning 
holoterminal. This was the fifth time this week she'd been 
called by a frantic client who claimed to see ghosts 
rising from the machine. Lumera knew these apparitions 
were nothing more than static, display glitches that took 
on an extra eerie appearance when suspended in thin air 
rather than projected on a screen. Lumera knew that the 
scattering of pixels buzzing about in front of her was a 
result of some error in the system. Still, she felt a 
shiver run up her spine as she recalled the client's 
panicked message. It had been decades since the first 
holoterminals were released to the consumer market. People 
had difficulty ignoring strange, floating images they had 
no control over.

She reached in the back of the holoterminal, groping for the 
power cable to the ionic magnifier. She had just replaced 
this part when she was here two days ago. Lumera was absolutely certain
that the magnifier was the cause, and now to find that there 
is an issue with a brand new part made this problem all the more
peculiar.
Lumera located the serial number on the magnifier and the location 
of the nearest Maximum Manufacturing checkpoint, or MaXMaN for short.
There wasn't a person alive that didn't rely on MaXMaN; since the 
trade agreement of 2052 there wasn't much of a choice.
She punched the com-text number of the MaXMaN checkpoint facility into
her CrypBit phone to check if the facility had another ionic
magnifier on hand that would be compatible with the holoterminal model
belonging to Ms. Rotherfield. There was no point in spending the travel
points if there is no replacement part; travel points were expensive enough.
While she was waiting for the MaXMaN representative to respond to
her inquiry Lumera noticed a flash behind her near the terminal.
Her first thought was that the main power input was still live and
beginning to cause the thermal flux controller to short without the
presence of the ionic magnifier. She rushed to the main power switch
to find that it was powered down.
Lumera had only a few seconds to ponder this confusion when the
holoscreen blinked on...
