Lumera heaved a low sigh, frowning at the malfunctioning 
holoterminal. This was the fifth time this week she'd been 
called by a frantic client who claimed to see ghosts 
rising from the machine. Lumera knew these apparitions 
were nothing more than static, display glitches that took 
on an extra eerie appearance when suspended in thin air 
rather than projected on a screen. Lumera knew that the 
scattering of pixels buzzing about in front of her was a 
result of some error in the system. Still, she felt a 
shiver run up her spine as she recalled the client's 
panicked message. It had been decades since the first 
holoterminals were released to the consumer market. People 
had difficulty ignoring strange, floating images they had 
no control over.

She reached in the back of the holoterminal, groping for the 
power cable to the ionic magnifier. She had just replaced 
this part when she was here two days ago. Lumera was absolutely certain
that the magnifier was the cause, and now to find that there 
is an issue with a brand new part made this problem all the more
peculiar.
Lumera located the serial number on the magnifier and the location 
of the nearest Maximum Manufacturing checkpoint, or MaXMaN for short.
There wasn't a person alive that didn't rely on MaXMaN; since the 
trade agreement of 2052 there wasn't much of a choice.
She punched the com-text number of the MaXMaN checkpoint facility into
her CrypBit phone to check if the facility had another ionic
magnifier on hand that would be compatible with the holoterminal model
belonging to Ms. Rotherfield. There was no point in spending the travel
points if there is no replacement part; travel points were expensive enough.
While she was waiting for the MaXMaN representative to respond to
her inquiry Lumera noticed a flash behind her near the terminal.
Her first thought was that the main power input was still live and
beginning to cause the thermal flux controller to short without the
presence of the ionic magnifier. She rushed to the main power switch
to find that it was powered down.
Lumera had only a few seconds to ponder this confusion when the
holoscreen blinked on...

Lumera stood there in shock, gazing down upon the ionic
magnifier that was still in her hands, which were clamming up
as the holoterminal's slowly pulsing light reflected 
onto her face. She looked up in disbelief, realizing
that the holoterminal seemed to be functioning without power.
She shakily set the ionic magnifier down on the table beside her
nearly missing the surface. As Lumera stared into the beaming 
aura of static-light, she quickly tried to compose herself and 
troubleshoot this situation in her mind. She had always been a 
woman of science. She was STILL a woman of science. "The 
holoterminal must be connected to a back-up generator", she 
thought, but quickly remembered that this generation of hardware
was not designed with the required ports. "A USB battery 
connection!", she exclaimed out loud.  In 2017 they had finally 
created a battery strong enough to give power via USB to hardware 
of this magnitude. They weren't often used, as they still
only provided power for minutes before breaking, but 
there was no other possibility. They were small, so maybe it was 
hidden behind the holoterminal. Now that Lumera had regained her
composure, she walked to the backside of the glowing, static orb
and got down on her hands and knees. There was nothing there,
but she noticed the back panel was slightly ajar. As she opened
the panel door, she froze. The wires were cut. All of them.
Ms. Rotherfield must have cut the wires in her desperate, 
fearful frenzy right before she called. Lumera sat on the 
ground completely breathless, her brow gathering sweat. That's 
when she heard it.

It was a low pitched thrumming sound, similar to warp core readying 
for a jump to hyper-drive. But that, or course, was completely 
impossble because there was no power getting through the sliced 
and diced circuitry of this machine. Still on her hands and knees Lumera 
began to back out from behind the holoterminal. She was almost clear 
of it when the hair on the back of her neck and along the length
of her arms stood straight up. Not surprising really, when you consider
this is an elecrically charged staticy orb...but how?! 
She continued to back up until she came to an abrupt halt against 
something which was not as hard as the table she was trying to tell 
herself she'd run into. Again, she heard the deep thrumming sound, though 
far closer than the last time...and something warm blasted the back of her neck. 
She took a deep breath, swallowed the heart which had jumped to her throat, 
and stood up slowly with her eyes closed. As she did she ran through the facts 
in an attempt to maintain her calm. "One. Mrs. Rotherfield claims she saw ghosts 
or spirits. Two... it's a machine. Three: the ionic magnifer is NOT the culprit. 
Four <breathe Lumera!> - all the wires are cut. Five....there is no way this 
machine is on - so it isn't. Period." Speaking aloud she calmly announced "I'm 
going to open my eyes now and everyting is as it should be...except this holo-unit 
doesn't work anymore." She took a deep breath and released it slowly. 
She opened her eyes and found herself staring directly into a large golden-brown
orb which was far too close to her own green eyes. 
Again she heard the deep thrumming sound. But this time there was something else too.
