Lumera heaved a low sigh, frowning at the malfunctioning 
holoterminal. This was the fifth time this week she'd been 
called by a frantic client who claimed to see ghosts 
rising from the machine. Lumera knew these apparitions 
were nothing more than static, display glitches that took 
on an extra eerie appearance when suspended in thin air 
rather than projected on a screen. Lumera knew that the 
scattering of pixels buzzing about in front of her was a 
result of some error in the system. Still, she felt a 
shiver run up her spine as she recalled the client's 
panicked message. It had been decades since the first 
holoterminals were released to the consumer market. People 
had difficulty ignoring strange, floating images they had 
no control over.
